<h1>Best Movies According To Aadhilsha</h1>
<h2>My 5 top movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Pursuit of Happyness<br />(2007)</h3>
<p>“Pursuit Of happyness”! What it can teach us?
    I have seen this movie recently for second time, not because I didn’t understand but because I liked it 
    very much. So I thought I would share my opinion with you guyz. The movie is based on real life struggle 
    of a man with his small kid. Its a family movie. Whole family can sit and watch together This movies 
    does not only show the hard work also a never giving up. Relativity media, Columbia pictures, overbrook 
    entertainment have done the great job chossing such a great type of subject and presenting it on a big 
    screen.</p>
<h3>2. Forrest Gump<br /> (1997)</h3>
<p>A Life Like a Box of Chocolates:  Forrest Gump1994
   Forrest Gump is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of genre.It weaves together humor, drama,
   and historical touchstones, creating a story that is both deeply moving and endlessly entertaining.
   Tom Hanks delivers a career-defining performance as the titular character, Forrest, a man with a below-average
   IQ and a heart of gold. Hanks perfectly captures Forrest's innocence, his unwavering kindness, and his simple
   yet profound approach to life.</p>
<h3>3. Titanic<br />(1997)</h3>
<p>I find this movie one of my childhood favourites I was only 7 to 8 yrs old when it came out used to watch it
   loads on video back when modern technology Youtube did not exist. On 100th anniversary mum and I watched it in
    3d and recently watched it again together for 25th year since it was released it even went on my own to see 
    it again as its just so epic I just feel like I could watch it over 100 times.</p>
<h3>4. Captain Philips<br />(2013)</h3>
<p>This movie is incredible. It felt SO real and you could feel the fear, desperation, and suspense through the screen. 
   The acting was absolutely phenomenal. The pirates (Muse, played by Barkhad Abdi) in particular, were incredible actors
   and it was hard to believe they werent real pirates. The last scene with Tom Hanks had me shaken to my core as well.
   He did an amazing job portraying trauma and shock… it was mind-blowing acting!</p>
<h3>5. Fight Club<br /> (1999)</h3>
<p>Directed by David Fincher and based on the 1996 film of the same name, Fight Club revolves around an unnamed
   narrator suffering from amnesia, who is discontented with his life until he meets a soap maker named Tyler Durden,
   whom he forms a friendship with. Both men start a fight club and the narrator gets embroiled in a relationship
