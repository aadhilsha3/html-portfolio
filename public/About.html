            i always dreamt to become a chartered accountant.</p>
            <p>On the way of making my dreams to become a chartered accountant which is one of the toughest qualification to get in india.
            i was always getting distracted in my CA studies which requires 8-10 hrs a day for studying. i randomly
            bought some courses online about machine learning, programming etc... which i thought would be
            useful and should be fun.Fortunately, i just fell in love with programming especially on the web development.
            Now i have 10 years of experience on web development and as a perk to in my portfolio, i have made
            websites for 50+ successful business startups and 100+ websites for creators, bloggers, youtubers etc.
